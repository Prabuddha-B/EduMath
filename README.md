# EduMath
The "EduMath" project aims to develop an innovative and user-friendly educational online learning management system designed to help students enhance their mathematical skills through an interactive online platform.

This project will serve as the final project for our C# development course. EduMath will not only provide a valuable resource for students but also offer a powerful tool for teachers to track and manage their students' progress effectively.
